suhhh

don't know what i'm doing, don't need to, let's see what happens. learning html, i think css and js are coming up next. i want to learn how to build webpages and make them look sexy. from there i want to get a sexy job as a web developer. i want to keep learning about programming and developing skills that will add value to the world, and hopefully my life too. i want to get pumped about this shit but it's been difficult to get pumped because it's unfamiliar and difficult to learn. welp, time to work.
